## Configuration

### Credentials

The ECS Local Endpoints container uses the AWS SDK for Go, and thus it supports all of its [methods of configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/configuring-sdk.html). We recommend providing credentials via an AWS CLI Profile. To do this, mount `$HOME/.aws/` ([`%UserProfile%\.aws` on Windows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)) into the container. As shown in the example Compose file, the container path of the volume should be `/home/.aws/` because the environment variable `HOME` is set to `/home` in the image. This way, inside the container, the SDK will be able to find credentials at `$HOME/.aws/`. To use a non-default profile, set the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable on the Local Endpoints container.

The Local Endpoints container will retrieve temporary session credentials from STS.  To provide a custom CA bundle for the STS client, mount your certificates file into the Local Endpoints container at any of the following locations:
* `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`
* `/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt`
* `/etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem`
* `/etc/pki/tls/cacert.pem`
* `/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem/tls-ca-bundle.pem`

For example, on an Ubuntu machine, you can mount your machine's certificates file at `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` into the Local Endpoint container at `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`.

### Custom IAM and STS Endpoints

Local Endpoints can be configured to use custom IAM and STS endpoints. Simply define the `IAM_ENDPOINT` and `STS_ENDPOINT` environment variables in the Local Endpoints container.

This may be useful in scenarios where your application container is configured to obtain credentials from ECS (see [Vend Credentials to Containers](features.md#vend-credentials-to-containers)), but you do not want to provide Local Endpoints with AWS credentials. Providing an IAM and STS simulator and configuring the Local Endpoints container with custom IAM and STS endpoints enables testing without an AWS account.

See [`docker-compose.localstack.yml`](../examples/docker-compose.localstack.yml) for an example.

### Docker

Local Endpoints responds to Metadata requests with real data about the containers running on your machine. In order to do this, you must mount the [Docker socket](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#daemon-socket-option) into the container. Make sure the Local Endpoints container is given a volume with source path `/var/run` and container path `/var/run`.

### Environment Variables

General Configuration:
* `ECS_LOCAL_METADATA_PORT` - Set the port that the container listens at. The default is `80`.
* `IAM_ENDPOINT` - Set the endpoint used by the AWS SDK for IAM. The default is undefined, which results in using the default AWS region.
* `STS_ENDPOINT` - Set the endpoint used by the AWS SDK for STS. The default is undefined, which results in using the default AWS region.

Task Metadata Configuration: while Local Endpoints returns real runtime information obtained from Docker in metadata requests, some values have no relevance locally and are mocked:
* `CLUSTER_ARN` - Set the 'cluster' name which is returned in Task Metadata responses. Default: `ecs-local-cluster`.
* `TASK_ARN` - Set ARN of the mock local 'task' which your containers will appear to be part of in Task Metadata responses. Default: `arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:111111111111:task/ecs-local-cluster/37e873f6-37b4-42a7-af47-eac7275c6152`.
* `TASK_DEFINITION_FAMILY` - Set family name for the mock task definition which your containers will appear to be part of in Task Metadata responses. Default: `esc-local-task-definition`.
* `TASK_DEFINITION_REVISION` - Set the Task Definition revision. Default: `1`.

Credentials Configuration:
* `SHARED_TOKEN_EXPIRATION` - Set an expiration duration (quantity + unit) for shared credentials when a session token is provided. This provides a hint for clients to refresh their credentials periodically. The default is 750s (12.5 minutes), which results in some clients (notably Boto3) opportunistically refreshing credentials in a background thread.
